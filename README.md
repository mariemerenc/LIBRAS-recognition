# LIBRAS Recognition

This project is an image classifier that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify LIBRAS (LÃ­ngua Brasileira de Sinais) signs. The model was trained with a dataset containing 1650 images for each of the 21 static letters of the language. The letters H, J, K, X and Z are not included in the original dataset because they require hand movement, as can be illustrated in the figures below:
